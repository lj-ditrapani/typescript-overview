- result.next unit test
- ColoredString unit tests
- display unit tests?
- command tests?
- item tests?
- Convert todoLogic to Todo class?
    - I kinda liked the multi-step Todo tests where an object state was built up and then used the list command to verify state.  It felt very natural to think about.  I kind of think passing items around is a little cumbersome.  Especially since we are mutating items...
- bigger todo unit test?
