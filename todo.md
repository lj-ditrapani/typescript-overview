- Convert todoLogic to Todo class?
    - I kinda liked the multi-step Todo tests where an object state was built up and then used the list command to verify state.  It felt very natural to think about.  I kind of think passing items around is a little cumbersome.  Especially since we are mutating items...
- Maybe get rid of commands and go back to Result subtypes (Exit,List(add, done, list),Help,Error(unknown, missing, unexpect, doneindex))
    - Right now, tests expect Output, and so we convert commands to output to do the match.
    - would it be better to have easier to test Results and Result have a toOutput method that loop calls?
- result.next unit test
- ColoredString unit tests
- display unit tests?
- command tests?
- item tests?
- bigger todo unit test?
- Update README!!!  Need to add updated teaching instructions.
- should have proper dev section.
